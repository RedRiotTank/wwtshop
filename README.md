World Wide Trade Shop is a plugin for Minecraft servers that will allow players on your server to buy or sell items to players on other servers that also have this plugin installed (or any other variant that also makes requests to the api).

This plugin will provide players with an inventory-based user interface that will allow them to view items for sale or list their owns.

## Installing Plugin

To install World Wide Trade Shop on your Minecraft server you just have to copy the "wwtshop-version.jar" file to your "/plugins" folder. Once you run the server with the plugin inside for the first time, it will generate a wwtshop/ folder where you can find the configuration file for the plugin.

## For developers
If for some reason you don't like this GUI plugin or would simply prefer some other kind of model, but still want to keep the overall trading system, I invite you to fork this repository to keep the API requests module and create your own system. This way, we will have multiples interfaces that endpoint on the same API.

You can find API repository [here](https://github.com/RedRiotTank/wwtapi).
